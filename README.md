Description:
This repository is what I'm using to store and share my submissions for the optional projects for the TechPrep program for the Murphy Centre. 
Please ignore this repository if you don't have anything to do with the mentioned program.

File Types:
As I'm only doing the Python Projects of this program, there will only be .ipynb files, as I'm specifically using Pyodide for these files.

Formatting:
Each Project will have its own file. Each assignment within Project 1 will have their own cell. As of yet there haven't been any issues though this formatting.
Please let me know if there are any issues.

Disclaimer:
This is my first time properly using GitHub, and thus I may have made mistakes in adding the files to the repository. 
Please let me know about any mistakes I may have made and how to rectify them.
